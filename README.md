## Notice
We've received reports of a glitch with OptiFabric and certain shader packs that can cause the skybox to flash rapidly at night. Because of Optifine's closed-source nature, we cannot fix these bugs; **if you suffer from epilepsy or any other similar conditions that might make you sensitive to flashing lights, it is heavily recommended that you do not use OptiFabric with this mod.**
